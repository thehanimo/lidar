# Virtual Generation of Lidar Data for Autonomous Vehicles
*Note that this project is no longer maintained, but should still be functional.*

This is a Lidar simulator created in the game engine Unity, its purpose is to generate lidar data virtually, without the need of a real Lidar sensor. 

## About
This project was part of a Bachelor thesis and project conducted at the Computer Science and Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Sweden, during the spring 2017.
